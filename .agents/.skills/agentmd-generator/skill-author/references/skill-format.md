# `SKILL.md` format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

  **Minimal example:**

  ```markdown SKILL.md theme={null}
  ---
  name: skill-name
  description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
  ---
  ```

  **Example with optional fields:**

  ```markdown SKILL.md theme={null}
  ---
  name: pdf-processing
  description: Extract PDF text, fill forms, merge files. Use when handling PDFs.
  license: Apache-2.0
  metadata:
    author: example-org
    version: "1.0"
  ---
  ```
</Card>

#### `name` field

The required `name` field:

* Must be 1-64 characters
* May only contain unicode lowercase alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `0-9`) and hyphens (`-`)
* Must not start or end with a hyphen (`-`)
* Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
* Must match the parent directory name

<Card>
  **Valid examples:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: pdf-processing
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: data-analysis
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: code-review
  ```

  **Invalid examples:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: PDF-Processing  # uppercase not allowed
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: -pdf  # cannot start with hyphen
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  name: pdf--processing  # consecutive hyphens not allowed
  ```
</Card>

#### `description` field

The required `description` field:

* Must be 1-1024 characters
* Should describe both what the skill does and when to use it
* Should include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks

<Card>
  **Good example:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
  ```

  **Poor example:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  description: Helps with PDFs.
  ```
</Card>

#### `license` field

The optional `license` field:

* Specifies the license applied to the skill
* We recommend keeping it short (either the name of a license or the name of a bundled license file)

<Card>
  **Example:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  license: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms
  ```
</Card>

#### `compatibility` field

The optional `compatibility` field:

* Must be 1-500 characters if provided
* Should only be included if your skill has specific environment requirements
* Can indicate intended product, required system packages, network access needs, etc.

<Card>
  **Examples:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  compatibility: Designed for Claude Code (or similar products)
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  compatibility: Requires git, docker, jq, and access to the internet
  ```

  ```yaml theme={null}
  compatibility: Requires Python 3.14+ and uv
  ```
</Card>

<Note>
  Most skills do not need the `compatibility` field.
</Note>

#### `metadata` field

The optional `metadata` field:

* A map from string keys to string values
* Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec
* We recommend making your key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts

<Card>
  **Example:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  metadata:
    author: example-org
    version: "1.0"
  ```
</Card>

#### `allowed-tools` field

The optional `allowed-tools` field:

* A space-separated string of tools that are pre-approved to run
* Experimental. Support for this field may vary between agent implementations

<Card>
  **Example:**

  ```yaml theme={null}
  allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read
  ```
</Card>

### Body content

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions. Write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.

Recommended sections:

* Step-by-step instructions
* Examples of inputs and outputs
* Common edge cases

Note that the agent will load this entire file once it's decided to activate a skill. Consider splitting longer `SKILL.md` content into referenced files.
