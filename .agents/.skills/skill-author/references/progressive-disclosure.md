# Progressive disclosure

Agents load skills *progressively*, pulling in more detail only as a task calls for it. Skills should be structured to take advantage of this:

1. **Metadata** (\~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (\< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files (e.g. those in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`) are loaded only when required

Keep your main `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.
